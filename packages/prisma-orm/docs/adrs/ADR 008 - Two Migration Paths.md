# ADR 008 — Two Migration Paths: Runtime Auto-Migration and CLI-Managed

## Context

IndexedDB is a browser-local database. Unlike server-side databases (Postgres, SQLite, MongoDB), there is no deploy step where a CLI can connect to a live database and apply migrations before the application serves traffic. The browser opens the database when the user visits the page — there is no "before" moment.

However, teams building production applications want:

- **Reviewable migration history** — git-tracked migration files that show what DDL changed and why.
- **CI verification** — `prisma-next db verify` in CI to catch schema drift before it reaches users.
- **Explicit control** — the ability to author data-transform migrations (backfills, type casts) that can't be derived from a pure schema diff.

These two forces — browser-local always-on vs. team-level control — pull in opposite directions.

## Decision

We provide **two migration paths** that share the same planner and runner:

### Path A — Runtime auto-migration (the default)

```ts
// One function call, zero config
const db = await createAutoMigratingIdbClient({ contract, dbName: "my-app" });
```

Under the hood:

1. Opens the live IDB database and introspects the current schema — reads `objectStoreNames`, `indexNames`, `keyPath`, `unique`, `multiEntry` for each user store. Also reads the `_prisma_next_marker` store to get the last-signed `storageHash`.
2. If the marker's `storageHash` matches the contract → instant open, no overhead.
3. Otherwise, builds a synthetic `fromContract` from the introspected schema, passes it to the planner so the diff produces only the delta (add/drop), opens IDB at the next integer version, applies the ops in `upgradeneeded`, and writes the new marker.

This is the **only** path needed for local dev, prototypes, and SPAs without a server.

> **Implementation note.** Earlier revisions passed `fromContract: null` regardless of live state, which forced the planner to emit a "from scratch" plan. That broke any contract evolution (the runner would try to `createObjectStore` on stores that already existed and abort the version-change tx). Live-DB introspection is now the canonical input for the planner on Path A.

### Path B — CLI-managed migrations (opt-in)

```bash
prisma-next db sign        # write contract marker to manifest
prisma-next db verify      # check marker matches contract
prisma-next migration new  # scaffold a migration.ts
prisma-next db update      # plan + apply, bump idbVersion in manifest
```

Requires a `prisma.config.ts` that wires the family, target, adapter, and driver descriptors. The CLI reads/writes `prisma-idb.manifest.json` — the on-disk record of the last-applied `idbVersion` and contract marker.

When using Path B, the runtime can pass the manifest through so it respects the CLI-managed `idbVersion`:

```ts
import manifest from "../prisma-idb.manifest.json" with { type: "json" };
const db = await createAutoMigratingIdbClient({ contract, dbName: "my-app", manifest });
```

> **Note.** The command names above (`prisma-next db sign/verify`, `prisma-next migration new`, the `prisma-idb.manifest.json` bridge) predate the Phase 7 rewrite. The current IDB-specific CLI is `prisma-idb generate-baseline` / `generate-migration` / `generate-contract-space` / `preflight` (`family-idb/src/bin/prisma-idb.ts`) and there is no manifest file — the concepts below (Path B as the hand-authorable, git-tracked path; `migration.ts` as its editable source) still hold, just under different command names. This applies to every remaining reference to `prisma-idb.manifest.json`, `prisma.config.ts`, and the `prisma-next db …`/`prisma-next migration …` commands for the rest of this document (the "Shared infrastructure" diagram, the `dbName` section, and the Consequences below) — they're kept as originally written since the manifest-vs-`storageHash` and `dbName`-as-space-boundary reasoning is unchanged, only the concrete filenames/commands are historical.

### `migration.ts` must round-trip exactly

Every migration package ships three interchangeable representations of the same operations: `ops.json` (what the runtime applies), `migration.json` (the content-addressed `migrationHash` over `ops.json`, verified on every Path A load — see `walkChain` in `client-idb/src/core/auto-migrate.ts`), and `migration.ts` (the human-editable class scaffold `generate-baseline`/`generate-migration` render alongside them).

`migration.ts` is not a passive artifact — hand-authoring depends on it being _exactly_ reproducible. `node migration.ts` (via `MigrationCLI.run` → `buildMigrationArtifacts` in vendor's `migration-base.ts`) re-derives `ops.json`/`migration.json` straight from the class's `operations` getter, with **no target-specific knowledge**: it serializes whatever the getter returns, verbatim. If the rendered TypeScript doesn't losslessly capture everything the original ops had, re-running the file — the exact workflow a developer uses to hand-edit a migration, and, before CLI `--space` support existed, the _only_ way to author a second migration for an extension space — silently regenerates a **different** `ops.json` with a **different** `migrationHash` than what's committed.

This bit us once: `renderMigrationTs`'s `renderOpCall` (`target-idb/src/core/migration-planner.ts`) used to (a) default a missing `unique` to `false` and always render it — but `JSON.stringify` drops an `undefined` key while keeping an explicit `false`, so an index whose `unique` was never set (the contract canonicaliser strips `unique: false` by default-stripping) would round-trip into one that explicitly has it — and (b) drop `def.indexes` entirely when rendering a `createObjectStoreOp` call, even though `diffIdbSchema` embeds the full store definition (indexes included) into that op's `def` for a freshly-created store. Both are covered now: `target-idb/test/migration.test.ts`'s `renderTypeScript() round-trips unique/multiEntry/indexes exactly (regression)` snapshot pins the full rendered output across every combination, and `family-idb/test/generate-baseline.test.ts`'s `migration.ts matches ops.json exactly` test locks in that both files describe the same operations for extension-space baselines (the same class of bug that let the marker-store op drift between the two files in the sync-extension package — fixed by rendering both from the same filtered `ops`, see `generate-baseline.ts`).

### Shared infrastructure

Both paths use the **same** types, planner, runner, and marker store:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│                  IdbMigrationPlanner                │
│                  IdbMigrationRunner                 │
│              _prisma_next_marker store              │
├───────────────────────┬─────────────────────────────┤
│      Path A           │         Path B              │
│  (runtime, browser)   │    (CLI, design-time)       │
│                       │                             │
│  createAutoMigrating  │  prisma-next db update      │
│    IdbClient()        │  prisma-next migration new  │
│                       │  prisma.config.ts           │
│  No config needed     │  prisma-idb.manifest.json   │
└───────────────────────┴─────────────────────────────┘
```

The manifest's `idbVersion` field is the bridge: the CLI bumps it when applying migrations, and the runtime reads it (when provided) to compute the correct `targetVersion` for `IDBFactory.open()`. When the manifest is not provided, the runtime probes the live database to discover the current version.

### `dbName` is the space boundary (not `spaceId`)

The vendor framework (Postgres, Mongo) uses `spaceId` to partition a **single database connection** into logical slices — one per extension pack — sharing the same underlying connection. This works because SQL databases have schemas and Mongo has collections inside a single cluster handle.

IndexedDB has no such nesting. Its only namespace primitive is the **database name** passed to `indexedDB.open(name, version)`. Every object store is flat at the top level inside that database. You cannot create "schemas inside a database" — the database name **is** the space.

**Therefore, `dbName` — not `spaceId` — is the natural isolation boundary for IDB:**

```
indexedDB.open("my-app")          → users, posts, _prisma_next_marker
indexedDB.open("my-app-tenant-b") → users, posts, _prisma_next_marker
```

Each database name gets its own:

- Version counter (IDB enforces monotonic per-name)
- Object stores and indexes
- `_prisma_next_marker` store
- Manifest `idbVersion` (one per database, tracked via `prisma-idb.manifest.json`)

This means **multi-tenancy in IDB is achieved by varying `dbName`**, not by introducing a nested `spaceId` concept. For single-database use, we hardcode `spaceId = "app"` to satisfy the vendor's `MigrationPlanner.plan()` interface — it costs nothing and the parameter is ignored by the IDB planner.

We deliberately chose **not** to map `spaceId` to `dbName` because:

| If we did this...              | Problem                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| ------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `spaceId = dbName` everywhere  | Conflates the vendor's "extension slice" concept with IDB's "database" concept. When IDB extensions arrive (future), they'd need true `spaceId` partitioning within a single database to share transactions. |
| `spaceId = some tenant prefix` | The manifest tracks one `idbVersion` per file; per-tenant manifests would need per-tenant files. That's correct (each database has its own version), but it muddies the CLI's single-manifest model.         |

Keeping `spaceId = "app"` and using `dbName` as the user-facing multi-tenancy primitive keeps both concepts clean and future-proof.

### Which path when?

| Concern                              | Path A (runtime) | Path B (CLI) |
| ------------------------------------ | :--------------: | :----------: |
| Local dev / prototype                |        ✅        |      —       |
| SPA with no server                   |        ✅        |      —       |
| Git-tracked migration history        |        —         |      ✅      |
| CI verification (`db verify`)        |        —         |      ✅      |
| Data-transform migrations (backfill) |        —         |      ✅      |
| Team review of DDL changes           |        —         |      ✅      |

## What we deliberately did not do

**Make the CLI mandatory.** This would break the zero-config SPA use case — the whole point of IDB is that it works without a server. Path A is the default; Path B is an opt-in upgrade for teams.

**Make runtime auto-migration the only path.** This would make it impossible to author data-transform migrations, review DDL changes in PRs, or verify schema integrity in CI. Teams building production apps need these capabilities.

**Have separate planner/runner for each path.** This would create a correctness fork — a migration that works in the CLI but fails at runtime (or vice versa). By sharing the same planner and runner, both paths produce identical DDL for the same contract diff.

**Auto-detect which path is active.** We considered having the runtime detect whether a `prisma.config.ts` exists and switch behavior automatically. We rejected this because it would make the runtime's behavior path-dependent on filesystem state, which is hard to test and reason about. The explicit `manifest` parameter is a cleaner contract.

**Generate migration files from the runtime.** The runtime could theoretically write `migration.ts` files back to disk after auto-migrating. We rejected this because the browser has no filesystem access — and even with the File System Access API, writing back to the developer's source tree from a production page is the wrong direction.

## Consequences

- The `client-idb` package exports two entry points: `client` (no migration) and `client-auto` (auto-migration). Users pick based on whether they want Path A or just the raw ORM.
- `createAutoMigratingIdbClient` is async (migration may run) while `createIdbClient` is synchronous (no migration).
- The `prisma-idb.manifest.json` file is the on-disk bridge between paths. Losing it means the CLI loses track of `idbVersion` — the runtime can still auto-migrate, but the CLI must re-sign.
- The manifest is only written by the CLI. The browser runtime never writes it (no filesystem access). This means `idbVersion` in the manifest can lag behind the actual IDB version if the runtime auto-migrates without a manifest. The `storageHash` comparison is always the authoritative check (ADR 001).
