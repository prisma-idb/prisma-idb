## 0.6.1

### Patch Changes

- [#229](https://github.com/prisma-idb/prisma-idb/pull/229) [`a2d2d04`](https://github.com/prisma-idb/prisma-idb/commit/a2d2d0446ea91f34b68e6113be1f251beae87db1) Thanks [@WhyAsh5114](https://github.com/WhyAsh5114)! - Publish the Prisma 8 packages under the `@prisma-idb` scope.

## 0.6.0

### Minor Changes

- [#215](https://github.com/prisma-idb/prisma-idb/pull/215) [`a536222`](https://github.com/prisma-idb/prisma-idb/commit/a536222379c2d16ddd66c75ae0c0e4e948ea67a0) Thanks [@WhyAsh5114](https://github.com/WhyAsh5114)! - `IdbRuntime.execute()` is split into `query()` (returns rows, as an `AsyncIterableResult<Row>`) and `execute()` (returns `RuntimeStatementStats` — `{ affectedRows }` — for statements run purely for their side effects), mirroring the upstream `RuntimeCore` split. Every internal call site (`client-idb`'s store accessor, relation loader, mutation executor) has moved to `query()`.

  Alongside the split, `driver-idb`'s delete execution now walks a cursor instead of calling `store.delete(key)` directly, so both single-key and range (`deleteMany`) deletes echo back the rows they actually removed and report an accurate `affectedRows` count — previously delete always resolved with an empty result regardless of what was deleted.

  **Breaking:** anything constructing or calling `IdbRuntime` directly (not through `client-idb`'s generated client) must switch its read paths from `execute()` to `query()`; `execute()` now returns statement stats, not rows.

### Patch Changes

- [#215](https://github.com/prisma-idb/prisma-idb/pull/215) [`a536222`](https://github.com/prisma-idb/prisma-idb/commit/a536222379c2d16ddd66c75ae0c0e4e948ea67a0) Thanks [@WhyAsh5114](https://github.com/WhyAsh5114)! - Moves every package off the archived `@prisma-next/*`-scoped fork onto the packages it merged into upstream: `@prisma/orm-framework`, `@prisma/orm-postgres`, `@prisma/orm-toolchain`, and `@prisma/cli-engine`, all pinned to `8.0.0-rc.5`. This is a mechanical import-path rewrite with no behavior change on its own — the migration content-hash format (bare hex, no `sha256:` prefix) already shipped in an earlier release and is unaffected.

  Config files that consuming apps author now follow the upstream-unified `prisma.config.ts` / `prisma.config.postgres.ts` naming (replacing `prisma-next.config.ts`), matching the same `@prisma/cli-engine` envelope every other ORM family uses.
