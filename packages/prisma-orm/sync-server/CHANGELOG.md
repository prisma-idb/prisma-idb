# @prisma-idb/sync-server

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- [#234](https://github.com/prisma-idb/prisma-idb/pull/234) [`f89746c`](https://github.com/prisma-idb/prisma-idb/commit/f89746cfdeb2f4055bdc389efd64941f85d0886b) Thanks [@WhyAsh5114](https://github.com/WhyAsh5114)! - Support Prisma `8.0.0-rc.12` (`prisma@8.0.0-rc.17`). The packages now depend on `@prisma/orm-framework` / `@prisma/orm-toolchain` `8.0.0-rc.12` and `@prisma/cli-engine` `0.6.1`.

  - IDB codecs declare a `dataType`, and the IDB target registers those data types, so `prisma contract emit` works again.
  - The PSL contract providers (`prismaIdbContract`, `sqlContractWithSync`) use the new multi-document parser API. Diagnostics point at the configured schema path.
  - The `prisma-idb` CLI no longer imports the removed `finalizeConfig`. The config section now resolves `contract.output` / `migrations.dir` itself.
  - To-one relations carry the `nullable` flag the emitter now requires. PSL derives it from the relation field (`User?`). `defineContract` derives it from the local FK fields and accepts an explicit `nullable` override.
  - `contract.d.ts` types an index without a `unique` flag as `unique: false`.
  - The sync server's Postgres `defineConfig` binds `DateTime` to the JS-`Date` codec (`pg/timestamptz-date@1`). rc.12's default Temporal codec needs a global `Temporal` that Node 24 does not provide, and IDB clients sync `Date`s. The column type is still `timestamptz`.
  - `applyPushEvent` turns ISO strings on `DateTime` fields back into `Date`s before writing, because push payloads arrive as JSON.

  Re-emitted contracts keep the same `storageHash`, so existing IndexedDB databases need no migration.

## 0.3.2

### Patch Changes

- [#231](https://github.com/prisma-idb/prisma-idb/pull/231) [`78131cf`](https://github.com/prisma-idb/prisma-idb/commit/78131cffdb4bbb02ec91bf6a0a57bb72d193f4a2) Thanks [@WhyAsh5114](https://github.com/WhyAsh5114)! - Adds compound primary keys and compound secondary indexes. `@@id([a, b])`, `@@unique([a, b])` and `@@index([a, b])` (PSL) and the equivalent TS-DSL `keyPath`/`IndexDef.keyPath` arrays now map directly to IndexedDB array `keyPath`s (`createObjectStore(name, { keyPath: [...] })` / `createIndex(name, [...])`). Previously `@@id([...])` was rejected with a claim that IndexedDB doesn't support compound keys, which is not true, so schemas with join tables or composite natural keys couldn't target the IDB family at all. Default compound index names join the member fields (`byUserId_effectiveFrom`-style), and schema diffing/verification and DDL emission are array-aware.

  `client-idb` builds and compares keys through shared helpers (`extractKeyFromRow`, `keyEquals`, `keyToken`), so compound keys work across `findUnique`, `update`, `delete`, `upsert`, cascades and `include()`. `keyEquals`/`keyToken` also compare `Date` and binary keys by value (including inside compound keys) rather than by reference. `CreateInput` now only makes the primary key optional when something actually fills it: a single-field `@default(autoincrement())` key (IndexedDB's key generator) or a key with its own `@default` such as `uuid()`/`cuid()`. A plain `@id` with no default, and every compound-key member without its own `@default`, is now required, since IndexedDB can't generate those keys and `create()` would otherwise fail at runtime with a `DataError`. Compound and `multiEntry` indexes are deliberately not used for single-field equality acceleration; accelerating them is left to the query planner.

  **Breaking (`client-idb`):** `getKeyPath` now throws when a model has no `storage.keyPath` instead of silently falling back to `"id"`, which used to mask malformed contracts.

  `sync-server` doesn't support compound-key models yet; `createSyncServer` now says so explicitly (and how to work around it) instead of reporting a generic "not a string keyPath" error.

- [#229](https://github.com/prisma-idb/prisma-idb/pull/229) [`a2d2d04`](https://github.com/prisma-idb/prisma-idb/commit/a2d2d0446ea91f34b68e6113be1f251beae87db1) Thanks [@WhyAsh5114](https://github.com/WhyAsh5114)! - Publish the Prisma 8 packages under the `@prisma-idb` scope.

### Minor Changes

- [#227](https://github.com/prisma-idb/prisma-idb/pull/227) [`46376ac`](https://github.com/prisma-idb/prisma-idb/commit/46376acf221ca837f0caadf616c45c285a2dc16a) Thanks [@WhyAsh5114](https://github.com/WhyAsh5114)! - Replace `writeSqlSchemaWithSync` with `sqlContractWithSync`, a file-free version of the same transform: it decomposes the SQL family's `prismaContract()` into its component parts and substitutes an in-memory `load()`, so the sync `Changelog` model can be injected into a real server schema without ever writing a generated `.prisma` file to disk (see [prisma/orm#30115](https://github.com/prisma/orm/issues/30115)). It needs the core `defineConfig` wired by hand rather than a target's convenience wrapper (which only accepts a schema path for `contract`) — see the README for the full example.

  Also adds `@prisma-next-idb/sync-server/postgres`, a `defineConfig({ schema, output?, db?, migrations? })` facade that hides that wiring for the common Postgres case — mirroring the pattern `@prisma/orm-postgres/config` itself uses.

  **Breaking:** `writeSqlSchemaWithSync` is removed. Pre-1.0, so this ships as a minor bump rather than major.

  **Migration note:** if your `schema.prisma` still has a hand-authored `Changelog` model or `ChangeOperation` enum from before either helper existed, delete them — `sqlContractWithSync`/`@prisma-next-idb/sync-server/postgres` append both, and leaving your own declarations in place produces duplicate PSL declarations that fail contract generation.

## 0.2.3

### Patch Changes

- [#215](https://github.com/prisma-idb/prisma-idb/pull/215) [`a536222`](https://github.com/prisma-idb/prisma-idb/commit/a536222379c2d16ddd66c75ae0c0e4e948ea67a0) Thanks [@WhyAsh5114](https://github.com/WhyAsh5114)! - Moves every package off the archived `@prisma-next/*`-scoped fork onto the packages it merged into upstream: `@prisma/orm-framework`, `@prisma/orm-postgres`, `@prisma/orm-toolchain`, and `@prisma/cli-engine`, all pinned to `8.0.0-rc.5`. This is a mechanical import-path rewrite with no behavior change on its own — the migration content-hash format (bare hex, no `sha256:` prefix) already shipped in an earlier release and is unaffected.

  Config files that consuming apps author now follow the upstream-unified `prisma.config.ts` / `prisma.config.postgres.ts` naming (replacing `prisma-next.config.ts`), matching the same `@prisma/cli-engine` envelope every other ORM family uses.

Server-side sync ownership DAG (ADR 014): given a `rootModel`, builds an authorization graph from the contract's relations at startup, then resolves per-record ownership checks for push validation and pull scoping. Transport- and storage-agnostic — `validatePush`/`buildPullQueries` return descriptions of what to check, and the caller executes them. Family-agnostic aside from one pluggable primary-key resolution point (`getKeyField`), defaulting to IDB's shape.
